I'm a software engineer drawn to building products that positively impact our lives and the planet.
I develop free and open-source software by day and play [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com) by night.

I writes about life, video games, movies, code, design, and more. I enjoy playing chess, cafe hopping, programming, stargazing, and reading.

Welcome to my blog. ^_^ (perhaps it is also called my digital garden. ðŸŒ±)

I'm also a nerd.
